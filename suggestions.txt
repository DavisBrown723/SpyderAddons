Features

"my only request is a module that will play a 3d sound in a loop...maybe attached to a trigger point or something...
so I can add effects like sound effects of a market, call to prayer, african singing, etc. at certain points of the map.

Drone support system?

	- Work to overcome all the natural terribleness that commanding flying AI (especially drones) comes with.
